# Face-Mask-detection
MMDetection to detect if a person has face mask on or not.

We used 153 images to train our model.

coco_file is a sample of coco format needed for training the model.

Result_final is the final output of the model.

Selfannotation was done by using VGG.

More training needed for different type of mask discrimination.

I'll be working on correctness of mask wearing.
